# G-Sharp

A projectional editor for G-Sharp, a superset of Guido music notation, implemented in MPS

To use, download and install Jetbrains MPS and import this repo as a project. Information on how to use MPS can be found
on Jetbrains's website.

G-Sharp is intended to add a number of abstractions not present in Guido music notation, including the ability to add
chords based off root note and chord quality.
